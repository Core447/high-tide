## Contribution
### Icon needed
High Tide is looking for somebody to make or suggest a design for an icon. It needs to follow [GNOME HIG](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/guidelines/app-icons.html)

### Coding
There are some TODOs and FIXMEs in the code, you can start there. I'm trying to comment the code, but if needed you can contact me on Matrix (@nokse22:matrix.org) or on Github.

The application is made with GNOME Builder so it should just work if you clone the project and open it with Builder.

If you have contributed you can open a pull request.
